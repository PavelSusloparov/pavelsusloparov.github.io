# Back to Java

I decided to go back to Java and learn more about latest features(Java 14) by applying them in solving algorithms.
The idiom is "Kill two birds with one one stone".

Algorithms are based on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/PavelSusloparov/java-algorithms)

## First impression

* Switch Java version to Java 14 is less straightforward then Java 8 and earlier.

    SDK is not a part of yum repository, need to download tar.gz, unpack under root into the java location

* Switch from Kotlin to Java is painful, but possible. Java 8 streams help a lot, since I got used to use functional programming in Kotlin.

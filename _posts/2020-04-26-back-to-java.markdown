# Back to Java

I decided to go back to Java and learn more about the latest features(Java 14) by applying them to solving algorithms.
The idiom is "Kill two birds with one stone."

Algorithms problems can be found here - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

GitHub repo with solutions is here - [https://github.com/PavelSusloparov/java-algorithms](https://github.com/PavelSusloparov/java-algorithms)

## First impression

* Switch Java version to Java 14 is less straightforward comparing with Java 8 and earlier.

    SDK is not a part of yum repository, need to download tar.gz, unpack under root into the java location

* Switch from Kotlin to Java is painful, but possible. Java 8 streams help a lot since I picked up a habit of using functional programming in Kotlin.
